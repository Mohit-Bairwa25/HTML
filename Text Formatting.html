    The characters on the gate of the Konoha village have a secret meaning behind them.
    Konoha’s main gates have two Hiragana characters: "A" and "N".
    If put together they spell out “An,” which means hidden or hermitage in Japanese.
    Konoha was established as a village of peace, and was hidden from the other nations.
    It includes those who wish to find shelter from the war torn nations and wish to seek
    shelter within the gates of Konoha. The exterior of Konoha is made out of wood, resembling
    to the tori gates from traditional Japanese villages. Medieval Japan would typically have 
    these gates within their cities. Before the Boruto series, the gates and the buildings
    resembled the Meiji era, with some anachronistic infrastructure.
